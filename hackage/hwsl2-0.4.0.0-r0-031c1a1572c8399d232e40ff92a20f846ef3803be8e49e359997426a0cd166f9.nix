It holds:\n\n> hash (m1 <> m2) == hash m1 <> hash m2\n\nFollowing that, the hash function is also parallelisable. If a message can be divided\ninto a list of chunks, the hash of the message can be calculated in parallel:\n\n> mconcat (parMap rpar hash chunks)\n\nAll operations in this package are implemented in a very efficient manner using SSE instructions.";
